[HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) is the
protocol that powers the web. In this challenge, we'll build a HTTP/1.1 server
that is capable of serving multiple clients.

Along the way we'll learn about TCP servers,
[HTTP request syntax](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec5.html),
and more.


# Building

1. Ensure you have `python (3.11)` installed locally
1. Run `./your_program.sh` to run your program, which is implemented in
   `app/main.py`
